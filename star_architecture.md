# STAR (STIX Archiver) Architecture Document

## Executive Summary

STAR is an archiver designed to manage libraries of SMOF object files. It provides functionality to create, extract, and manipulate archives of SMOF files, enabling efficient library management for the STIX operating system.

## Design Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **SMOF Compatibility**: Full support for the SMOF format
2. **Efficient Archiving**: Minimize archive size and access time
3. **Ease of Use**: Simple command-line interface
4. **Extensibility**: Support for future SMOF extensions
5. **Reliability**: Ensure data integrity in archives

### Key Features
- Create and extract archives of SMOF files
- List contents of archives
- Add and remove files from archives
- Verify archive integrity

## Architecture Overview

### Input and Output

**Input**:
- SMOF object files
- Archive file (for extraction or modification)

**Output**:
- Archive file (for creation or modification)
- Extracted SMOF files

### Core Components

1. **Archive Header**: Stores metadata about the archive
2. **File Index**: Maintains a list of files in the archive
3. **Compression Engine**: (Optional) Compresses file data
4. **Integrity Checker**: Verifies archive integrity

## Detailed Design

### 1. Archive Header

The archive header contains metadata about the archive, such as the number of files and the total size.

```c
struct star_header {
    uint32_t magic;           // 0x53544152 ('STAR')
    uint16_t version;         // Format version (current: 1)
    uint16_t file_count;      // Number of files in the archive
    uint32_t index_offset;    // Offset to the file index
    uint32_t index_size;      // Size of the file index
};
```

### 2. File Index

The file index is a table that stores information about each file in the archive.

```c
struct star_file_entry {
    char name[64];            // File name
    uint32_t offset;          // Offset to file data
    uint32_t size;            // File size
    uint32_t checksum;        // File checksum
};
```

### 3. Compression Engine

The compression engine reduces the size of file data in the archive. It uses a simple algorithm like LZ77 for efficiency.

```c
void star_compress_file(const char* input, const char* output) {
    // Compress input file and write to output
}

void star_decompress_file(const char* input, const char* output) {
    // Decompress input file and write to output
}
```

### 4. Integrity Checker

The integrity checker verifies the checksum of each file in the archive to ensure data integrity.

```c
int star_verify_checksum(struct star_file_entry* entry, const char* data) {
    uint32_t checksum = calculate_checksum(data, entry->size);
    return (checksum == entry->checksum);
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Archive header parsing and validation
- File index operations (insertion, lookup, removal)
- Compression and decompression
- Checksum calculation and verification

### 2. Integration Tests
- Creating archives with multiple SMOF files
- Extracting files from archives
- Modifying existing archives

### 3. Performance Tests
- Archive creation time for large libraries
- Compression and decompression speed
- Memory usage profiling

### 4. Compatibility Tests
- Ensure compatibility with SMOF format
- Validate extracted files with SMOF loader

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Weeks 1-2)
- Archive header and file index implementation
- Basic archive creation and extraction

### Phase 2: Compression and Integrity (Weeks 3-4)
- Add compression and decompression support
- Implement integrity checker

### Phase 3: Optimization (Weeks 5-6)
- Performance tuning
- Memory usage optimization

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Weeks 7-8)
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation

## Conclusion

STAR provides a reliable and efficient solution for managing libraries of SMOF object files. Its design ensures compatibility with the SMOF format while offering features like compression and integrity checking, making it an essential tool for the STIX operating system.
