# STLD (STIX Linker) Architecture Document

## Executive Summary

STLD is a linker designed to support the STIX Minimal Object Format (SMOF). It is responsible for combining multiple SMOF object files into a single executable or shared library. STLD is optimized for memory-constrained environments and provides essential features such as symbol resolution, relocation, and support for position-independent code.

## Design Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **SMOF Compatibility**: Full support for the SMOF format
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Operate within <100KB memory
3. **Fast Linking**: Minimize linking time for embedded systems
4. **Extensibility**: Support for future SMOF extensions
5. **Debugging Support**: Generate debugging information

### Key Features
- Symbol resolution and conflict handling
- Relocation processing
- Support for static and shared libraries
- Position-independent code (PIC) support
- Debugging information generation

## Architecture Overview

### Input and Output

**Input**:
- SMOF object files
- Linker script (optional)

**Output**:
- Executable binary (static or dynamic)
- Shared library
- Map file (optional, for debugging)

### Core Components

1. **Symbol Table**: Maintains global symbols and resolves conflicts
2. **Relocation Engine**: Applies relocations to resolve addresses
3. **Section Merger**: Combines sections from multiple object files
4. **Output Generator**: Writes the final binary

## Detailed Design

### 1. Symbol Table

The symbol table is a hash table that stores symbols from all input object files. It resolves conflicts based on symbol binding and visibility.

```c
struct stld_symbol {
    char* name;              // Symbol name
    uint32_t address;        // Resolved address
    uint16_t section_index;  // Section index
    uint8_t binding;         // Local, global, or weak
    uint8_t type;            // Function, object, etc.
};
```

### 2. Relocation Engine

The relocation engine processes relocation entries in each input file and updates addresses in the output binary.

```c
void stld_process_relocation(struct smof_relocation* reloc, struct stld_symbol* symbol) {
    uint32_t* target = (uint32_t*)(output_base + reloc->offset);
    switch (reloc->type) {
        case SMOF_RELOC_ABS32:
            *target = symbol->address;
            break;
        case SMOF_RELOC_REL32:
            *target = symbol->address - (uint32_t)target - 4;
            break;
        // Additional relocation types...
    }
}
```

### 3. Section Merger

The section merger combines sections with the same name and attributes from multiple input files.

```c
void stld_merge_sections(struct smof_section* sections, int section_count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < section_count; i++) {
        if (strcmp(sections[i].name, ".text") == 0) {
            merge_text_section(&sections[i]);
        }
        // Handle other sections...
    }
}
```

### 4. Output Generator

The output generator writes the final binary, including the header, sections, and relocation information.

```c
void stld_write_output(const char* filename) {
    FILE* file = fopen(filename, "wb");
    fwrite(&output_header, sizeof(output_header), 1, file);
    fwrite(output_sections, sizeof(output_sections), 1, file);
    fclose(file);
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Symbol table operations (insertion, lookup, conflict resolution)
- Relocation processing for all supported types
- Section merging logic

### 2. Integration Tests
- Linking multiple SMOF object files into a single executable
- Generating shared libraries
- Handling invalid input files

### 3. Performance Tests
- Linking time for large projects
- Memory usage profiling

### 4. Compatibility Tests
- Ensure compatibility with SMOF format
- Validate output binaries with SMOF loader
